# Karate Kata Database with Django

## Project Description
The Kata Database notes all technique names and moveset in Shotokan Karate.
It displays each form's moveset with various searchable parameters.

The idea for this project came from my teacher (sensei) at my local Karate dojo. 

## Project Goal
My sensei want to run queries such as:

- How many blocks are done with the left arm in all forms?
- Are there more blocks or attacks in the Heian forms?
- Are there more right-handed moves for attacks in this form versus another form?
- How many left-hand strikes there are in all forms combined and how does that 
compare to number of right-hand strikes?
- How many attacks are in front-stance compared to blocks in back-stance?
- Which form has the most fast moves in a row and which has the most slow moves in a row?
- Number of techniques overlapping in one form compared to another form
